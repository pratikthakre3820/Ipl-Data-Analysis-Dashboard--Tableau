IPL analysis using Tableau (advanced visualization and data manipulation)

Project Requirements:

Gather and prepare their own data from appropriate data sources;
Determine the story (objective) or message for their data visualization;
Use advanced visualization and data manipulation (calculated parameters, tables etc) covered in the course (ie., Info Visualization for Big Data Analytics).
Use multiple sheets (above 6) in your workbook/story.
Build an interactive data visualization to tell their story;
Create a short presentation describing the data sources, their challenges, key findings and demonstrate their interactive visualization.
Goal: Providing Visualization on Preferring whom to buy in Next IPL auction.

What is IPL: The Indian Premier League is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India. It is contested during March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities in India. The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues. The brand value of IPL in 2018 was US$6.3 billion. According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed â‚¹12,543.5 billion to the GDP of the Indian economy.

Challenges:

Since it is a 10 years data set it does not contain all information in single data set. We got different 5 data sheets in total in which we have joined 3 of them together.
In one data sheet there was date format mismatch (i.e., different two date formats like DD/MM/YY and MM/DD/YY) we found them and changed manualy.
Couple of franchise changed their names over the years, so we have performed some data cleanup.
We have the data of each ball from all seasons and data is so big that tableau also took time for first time visualization.
What is biggest fear for Franchise owners?

IPL auction happens once in every 3 years
Whom to select and how much can they spend on each player.
They need to make sure that they cannot go beyond their limit while auctioning for players.
In one season one player salary can go so high and for the next auction he can go as low as possible based on his performance.
Conclusion: 1.Top 10 batsmen and bowlers based on their performance throughout all seasons. 2. In our project We will be foreseeing the valuable batsmen and valuable bowler by K means clustering and for which franchise he played the most. 3. Does toss decision makes any difference in win or lose.
